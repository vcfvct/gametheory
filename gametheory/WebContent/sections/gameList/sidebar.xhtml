				<h2>Rules</h2>
				<div style="padding: 10px">
					In this game, two companies, with decisions by their CEOs, obtained
					permission to manufacture in a developing country on the premise of
					at least one must provide schooling or pay a fine if neither
					provides schooling. <br /> Payoffs, profits or losses, will be
					reported after each round and are cumulative. Payoffs are a
					function of a static set of earnings minus the cost of schooling
					and a fine if no schooling is funded by one of the CEOs. <br />The
					static earnings are sufficient so that the cost of schooling and
					fines will only diminish profits. The cost for schooling is
					slightly higher than the fines. <br />A company will be rewarded
					if it provides schooling in any two of four rounds. The reward is
					an incentive. It means no more fines in the remained of the four
					rounds. Also, if the other CEO provides the schooling and one CEO
					has two periods of schooling cost, no fines. <br />Thus, the
					higher the profits in any four rounds mean both the company and the
					country benefit, although the benefit may come from the other CEO
					spending on schooling.
